> Various tools I've written and used to collect data for [Laniakean.com](https://laniakean.com)

More for me to keep track and backup these tools. They mostly parse and collect data from the web and insert them into an sqlite database. Some of the functions were written and run once, others are for easy data manipulation scripting. Explore the API I'm writing for the data in the [API docs](https://laniakean.com/api). Or just [learn about Laniakea](https://laniakean.com/what-is-laniakea)!
